#### "..type..Code.txt" Files ####

If you take a look in these, they will have two main sections; ".text" and ".data".

>".text"

This is where the binary for the code is. Humans read it as addi $t1, $t1, 1 the computer reads it as "0x01323281". Weird huh?

>".data"

This is where the beginning information is provided for the computation.
