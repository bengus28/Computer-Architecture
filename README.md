This is the repository for our class projects. Feel free to poke around and shoot us an email if you wish!

War Eagle.

Project 1
-------------

We have two simulators, one is a stack Machine and one is an Accumulator.
They both read in code from their respective "..type..Code.txt" files.

Each simulator has two parts. Memory simulation and the processor / instruction simulation.

We are trying to evaluate this equation: 

>A*X**2 + B*X + C
>> - x = 3
>> - A = 7
>> - B = 5
>> - C = 4
>
> Answer: 82

To run each machine, look at the readme file in project 1 folder!

Happy simulating
